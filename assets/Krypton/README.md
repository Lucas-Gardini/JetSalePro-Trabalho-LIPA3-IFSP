# Krypton Suite of .NET WinForms Controls
The Krypton Suite of .NET WinForms controls are now freely available for use in personal or commerical projects.

I developed and sold them from my company Component Factory from 2006 until 2014, when the lack of sales meant selling the controls was no longer viable. So I decided to make them open source so that .NET developers had a good set of free controls to use in their projects. Full source code for all the controls and components is included along with Visual Studio projects and solution files.

# Getting Started #
**Bin** directory contains already compiled copies of all the example projects and the Krypton assemblies, so I recommend you start by running the **Krypton Explorer** application in this directory. It lists all the controls along with example applications used to show them in operation.

# Documentation #
**Help** directory contains a **KryptonHelp.chm** file that can be double clicked to open the documentation. I recommend you read this before developing using the Krypton controls.

# Using with Visual Studio #
 - Start **Visual Studio** and create/open your Windows Forms project
 - Open the main Form of your application and show the **Toolbox**
 - Right click the **Toolbox** and **Add Tab**, give it the name **Krypton**
 - Right click inside the new tab and select **Choose items**
 - Click **Browse** and go to the **Bin** directory, and select all the **ComponentFactory.Krypton...** assemblies
 - Select **OK** and now you have them all in the **Toolbox!**

# Source #
**Source** directory contains the full source code that you can view, modify and directly compile. The **Krypton Components** sub-directory contains all the actual controls, the other directories are for the myriad example projects.

# Krypton Toolkit
49 basic controls with full and consistent theming.
